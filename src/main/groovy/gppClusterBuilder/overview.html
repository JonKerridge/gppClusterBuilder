The gppCluster Builder program converts the source definition of an application defined using
     the GPP library into a form that can be executed as a Groovy script. <p>

The source file is provided as \path\filename.cgpp .
     It is assumed that the suffix cgpp should be associated with groovy and means that the source
     is checked by the Groovy system during its creation.
     The source should contain all the required data definitions and assumes
     that all the required user developed code is available.
     These data definitions should precede the definition of the required process definitions.
     The format of the source file should be:<p>

<pre>
Constant declarations
Definitions of GPP Data, Result and Local and other Detail data objects
Initialisation code to be obeyed before the process network is created
Process definitions omitting input and output properties
     The definitions should appear in the order in which data flows
     through the process network; ordering is crucial.
Finalisation code
</pre>

Examples of the additional coding could include the initialisation of a start time with the
corresponding finalisation code being to print out the total execution time.<p>

The gppClusterBuilder program create a file called \path\filename.groovy.

     If the transformation generated errors then the output files will contain an indication of the
     error at the place where it was found in the source file.<p>

If the transformation was successful the output files will contain the application in a form that can be executed as Groovy scripts.
