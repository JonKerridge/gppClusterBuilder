The gppCluster Builder program converts the source definition of an application defined using
     the GPP library into a form that can be executed as a set of Groovy scripts, that enable code to be run
     on a network of workstations. <p>

The source file is provided as \path\App.cgpp .
     It is assumed that the suffix cgpp should be associated with groovy and means that the source
     is checked by the Groovy system during its creation.
     The source should contain all the required data definitions and assumes
     that all the required user developed code is available.
     These data definitions should precede the definition of the required process definitions.
     <p>

The gppClusterBuilder program creates four files called
     \path\AppHostLoader.groovy     args[0] = number of worker nodes in the cluster
     \path\AppNodeLoader.groovy     args[0] = hostIP address
     \path\AppHostProcess.groovy
     \path\AppNodeProcess.groovy.

     Only the loader programs can be executed.  The NodeLoader is, in fact, not application specific.
     Thus once a version of NodeLoader exists as a jar file then it can be used to load any application.

     The other files are application specific.  In particular, the emit and collect process elements are
     presumed to execute on the same node in a workstation.  The same workstation can also be one of the nodes
     used in the application.

     The package information contains more detail of the requiremtns of the App.cgpp file.

     If the transformation generated errors then the output files will contain an indication of the
     error at the place where it was found in the source file.<p>

     If the transformation was successful the output files will contain the application in a form that can
     be executed as Groovy scripts.

     The library contains an example, using a solution to Montecarlo pi, that runs as a cluster
     on a single workstation.

     The built system will output the time taken to load the application and the processing time
     on each node of the cluster.
